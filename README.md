# HID Remapper

_For user documentation please see the project's website at [remapper.org](https://www.remapper.org/)._

This is a configurable USB dongle that allows you to remap inputs from mice, keyboards and other devices. It works completely in hardware and requires no software running on the computer during normal use.

It can do things like reassign buttons, change keyboard layouts, map mouse buttons to keyboard inputs, map keystrokes to mouse inputs, change mouse sensitivity (permanently or when a button is held), rotate mouse axes by arbitrary (non-90 degree) angles, drag-lock for mouse buttons, scroll by moving the mouse, and much more.

It is configurable [through a web browser](https://www.remapper.org/config/) using WebHID (Chrome or Chrome-based browser required).

Wireless receivers are supported and multiple devices can be connected at the same time using a USB hub (with different mappings for each device if desired).

In addition to the remapping functionality, it can do polling rate overclocking up to 1000 Hz.

A separate [serial](SERIAL.md) version of the remapper takes inputs from a serial (RS-232) mouse and translates them to USB.

There's also a [Bluetooth](BLUETOOTH.md) version that runs on nRF52840-based boards, which translates Bluetooth inputs to USB.

## How to make the device

There are three main ways of making the HID Remapper. You can either buy [this board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5723) from Adafruit, make it yourself using a Raspberry Pi Pico (or two), or you can use the provided files to manufacture a custom board at JLCPCB or a similar service. The functionality is the same in all cases.

If you get the Feather RP2040 USB Host board from Adafruit, the device is ready to use, you just need to flash it with the right firmware ([remapper\_feather.uf2](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper/releases/latest/download/remapper_feather.uf2)). Hold the "Boot" button on the board, then press the "Reset" button. A USB drive should show up on your computer. Copy the UF2 file to that drive. That's it.

See [here](HARDWARE.md) for details on how to make the Pico variants of the device and [here](custom-boards/) for details on the custom board option.

## How to use the configuration tool

A live version of the web configuration tool can be found at [remapper.org/config](https://www.remapper.org/config/).

For details on how to use it, please see the [HID Remapper Manual](https://www.remapper.org/manual/).

If you can't use the browser-based configuration tool, there's also a [command-line tool](config-tool) that takes JSON in the same format as the web tool on standard input. I only tested it on Linux, but in theory it should also run on Windows and Mac.

## How to update the firmware

The procedure to update the firmware is similar on all variants. When you go to the configuration website and try to connect to your device when it doesn't have the latest firmware, you will get a message and a link to a version of the configuration interface that is compatible with your current (old) firmware. Click that link, connect to your HID Remapper by clicking "Open device" as usual, then go to the "Actions" tab and click "Flash firmware". This will put your device in firmware flashing mode. A drive should appear on your computer. For all the RP2040-based variants, the drive will be named "RPI-RP2". For the Bluetooth variants, it will be called something else, depending on what board you're using. Download the correct firmware file for your variant (see table below) and copy it to that drive. If the table below says "no" in the "Flash B side required" column then you're done. Go back to the regular version of the configuration interface and carry on. If it says "yes" in that column then before continuing you need to also flash the B side. Connect to your HID Remapper (using the regular version of the configuration interface), then go to the "Actions" tab and click "Flash B side". Then disconnect and reconnect your HID Remapper and you're done.

If you're using the dual Pico variant then you need to flash the A side using the [remapper\_dual\_a.uf2](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper/releases/latest/download/remapper_dual_a.uf2) file as described above and then flash the B side manually. Disconnect your HID Remapper from your computer, disconnect the OTG adapter from the B-side Pico, hold the BOOTSEL button on the B-side Pico and then, while holding the button, connect the B-side Pico to your computer. A drive named "RPI-RP2" should appear. Copy the [remapper\_dual\_b.uf2](https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper/releases/latest/download/remapper_dual_b.uf2) file to that drive. Disconnect the B-side Pico from your computer, reconnect the OTG adapter and reconnect your HID Remapper to your computer.

When updating firmware, the current configuration on your HID Remapper is preserved. For extra peace of mind you can export your configuration to a JSON file before performing the update. That way if you need to revert to the old version of the firmware for any reason, you'll be able to import the configuration from the JSON file (configuration is lost when going from a newer firmware to an older firmware).

## How to compile the firmware

The easiest way to compile the firmware is to let GitHub do it for you. This repository has GitHub Actions that build the firmware, so you can just fork, make your changes, wait for the job to complete, and look for the binaries in the artifacts produced.

To compile the RP2040/RP2350 firmware on your machine, use the following steps 

(details may vary depending on your OS/distribution):
Debian / Ubuntu Dependancies
```
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib srecord
```
Mac Dependancies
```
brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc srecord
```

Compile
```
git clone https://github.com/jfedor2/hid-remapper.git
cd hid-remapper
git submodule update --init
cd firmware
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
# or, to build for the custom boards:
# PICO_BOARD=remapper cmake ..
make
```

To compile the nRF52 firmware, you can either follow [Nordic's setup instructions](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/installation.html) and then `west build -b seeed_xiao_nrf52840` to compile the firmware, or you can use Docker with a command like this (start from the top level of the repository or adjust the path accordingly):

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workdir/project -w /workdir/project/firmware-bluetooth nordicplayground/nrfconnect-sdk:v2.2-branch west build -b seeed_xiao_nrf52840
```
